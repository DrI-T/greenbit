<h2>We are making crypto greener ! ... </h2>

<p>When we are talking about the carbon footprint of bitcoin and to a lesser level ethereum,
it seems irresponsible to allow such inefficient technology to exists.
<p>However I really believe blockchain can have tremendous benefits to society.
<br>I whish bitcoin didn't choose proof-of-work as a consensus protocol.
<p>While PoW can make sense for an <i>international DAO</i> to decide about cross continental contract,
or vote for an enact a new international law; for buying a pizza do we really need the world to know
and the world to validate and approve the transaction ?
<p> PoW might very much be an overkill.

<p>Still Bitcoin is the most popular crypto-currency and we have to align with the choice of
the majority (isn't it what democraty is about).
<br>
So what can we do with "mined" bitcoins ?
<ol>
        <li>first make sure we use renewable for powering the mining nodes
        <li>account for all emission and waste generate during the creation of the coinbase transaction.
        <li>offset the bitcoin with the appropriate audited carbon removal credit.
        <li>wrap the bitcoin and issue a carbon zero certificate
        <li>the wrapped bitcoin can be used in place of the bitcoin for any crypto purchase, or hodling its value.
</ol>
