```
Our Project *GreenerBit* is to create a ERC20 token for a Wrapped Bitcoin
where its mining CO2 footprint is attached to the contact, this is
like accounting for 2 balances:  the native coin balance and the CO2
balance. Redeemption (unwrapping) can only be done by the DAO with a proof
of carbon offset  i.e. a negative balance for the CO2 account. This way
every bitcoin swapped for ETH will be "environmentally clean".
